## Notes: Contains notes for the Offensive Security OSEP (Pen300) course and ideas or topics for further research

## Exam Prep: contains notes and code snippets that I prepared for use in the exam and challenge lab environment. 
## Windows: Code for the course that is either a result of the code presented in the modules or code of my own that is being worked on.

## Linux: Code for the course that is either a result of the code presented in the modules or code of my own that is being worked on.

**Note:** Do not assume all code works or executes properly. Most of the code is working in the OSEP labs or on my Win10 or Win11 VM. Always test prior to use. I've been moving the C# code from the class away from PInvoke.net to use CsWin32 (https://github.com/microsoft/CsWin32) where possible.
