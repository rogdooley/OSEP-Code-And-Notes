## Notes: Contains notes for the course and ideas or topics for further research


## Windows: Code for the course that is either a result of the code presented in the modules or code of my own that is being worked on.

**Note:** Do not assume all code works or executes properly. Most of the code is working in the OSEP labs or on my Win10 or Win11 VM. Always test prior to use. I've been moving the C# code from the class away from PInvoke.net to use CsWin32 (https://github.com/microsoft/CsWin32).


## Linux: Code for the course that is either a result of the code presented in the modules or code of my own that is being worked on.
